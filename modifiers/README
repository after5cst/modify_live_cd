This directory is an example of modifiers for the ISO image.
'Modifiers' are a series of executable items (e.g. scripts)
that will be run against the ISO image.

Modifiers are expected to set an exit code of 0 if they were
successful, and non-zero if they failed.  Any failure will
abort the modification of the ISO.

In order to be run against the image, the modifier must have
all of the following characteristics:

* Starts with 'A', 'B', or 'C' (more about this later)
* Is followed by a two digit decimal number
* Is marked as executable by the system

For example, the following items are all modifiers:
A03ClearTempFiles.sh
A52.py
C99FinishChrootChanges

And the following are not:
README
a03ClearTempFiles.sh
A5ANumbersAreDecimalNotHex.py
D01FinishChrootChanges

The leading character is a marker, denoting a class of modifier:

'B' are scripts to be run 'B'efore the chroot environment is started.
'C' are scripts to be run inside the 'C'hroot environment.
'A' are scripts to be run 'A'fter the chroot environment is exited.

For the most part, modifiers should be run with the 'C' prefix.

The two digit numeric value is just a sequence order, with 'C01' 
being run before 'C02' which is run before 'C57'.  Gaps in the 
sequence are allowed.

Any text following the first three characters ("C22") is merely for
file documentation.  "C22AddMyUser.sh" is much more self-descriptive
than "C22".
